WebGL 
- JavaScript API
- Render triangles at remarkable speed
- Result can be drawn in a <canvas> 
- Compatible with most modern browsers
- Uses the Graphic Processing Unit(GPU)
- can be used for 2D and 3D 
- The CPU can do calculations really fast but one by one 
- The GPU a little slower but do thousands of parallel calculation 

	- GPU position the point at once 
	- DO all the pixel 

- Shaders: instructions to place the points and draw the pixel are written 


ThreeJS 
- JavaScript library 
- MIT license 
- Right above WebGL 
- drastically simplify the process of all the process of WebGL
